# Journal Entry 002 - 2026-02-12 - Migrate to go-eventkit

## Goal
Replace `internal/eventkit/` (custom cgo+ObjC EventKit bridge) and AppleScript-based writes with `github.com/BRO3886/go-eventkit` — a standalone library extracted from rem that supports both reads AND writes via EventKit.

## What Changed
- **Deleted `internal/eventkit/`** — 4 files (~400 lines of cgo+ObjC): `eventkit_darwin.m`, `eventkit_darwin.h`, `eventkit.go`, `eventkit_other.go`
- **Renamed `internal/applescript/` → `internal/service/`** — package no longer primarily about AppleScript
- **Rewrote `internal/service/reminders.go`** — `ReminderService` now wraps `*reminders.Client` from go-eventkit. All CRUD (create, get, list, update, delete, complete/uncomplete) goes through EventKit. Only flagged operations still use AppleScript.
- **Rewrote `internal/service/lists.go`** — `ListService` wraps `*reminders.Client` for reads, keeps AppleScript for create/rename/delete (go-eventkit doesn't support list CRUD)
- **Updated `cmd/rem/commands/root.go`** — `reminders.New()` returns `(*Client, error)`, handled with `os.Exit(1)` on failure
- **Updated `pkg/client/client.go`** — `New()` now returns `(*Client, error)` (breaking API change). Uses go-eventkit internally.
- **Updated `pkg/client/client_other.go`** — Matching `New()` signature
- **Added tests**: `internal/service/reminders_test.go`, `internal/service/lists_test.go`, `pkg/client/client_test.go`
- **Updated all docs**: CLAUDE.md, README.md, MEMORY.md, website architecture/api/performance pages

## Key Insights
- **Field name mapping is the main complexity**: go-eventkit uses `Title`/`Notes`/`List`/`CreatedAt`/`ModifiedAt` while rem's internal model uses `Name`/`Body`/`ListName`/`CreationDate`/`ModificationDate`. The `fromEventKitReminder()` conversion function handles this.
- **URL backwards compat**: go-eventkit has a native `URL` field. Old reminders may still have URLs stored in notes with `URL: ` prefix. `fromEventKitReminder` checks both — native URL takes precedence, falls back to notes extraction.
- **Flagged is still broken in EventKit**: `EKReminder.flagged` is not exposed. JXA fallback for `--flagged` filter remains. AppleScript for flag/unflag writes remains. This is an Apple limitation.
- **go-eventkit's `CreateReminder` returns the created reminder** (with ID), while AppleScript just returned the ID string. Adapted `CreateReminder` to extract `.ID` from the returned reminder.
- **`UpdateReminder` split path**: Most fields go through go-eventkit's `UpdateReminderInput`. Flagged goes through AppleScript. The service layer handles this transparently.
- **`client.New()` is now fallible**: This is a breaking change for `pkg/client` consumers. Was `New() *Client`, now `New() (*Client, error)`. Necessary because `reminders.New()` can fail with `ErrAccessDenied` or `ErrUnsupported`.

## Decisions Made
- **Keep AppleScript executor** for list CRUD + flagged — minimal footprint (~130 lines), no cgo dependency
- **Renamed `internal/applescript` → `internal/service`** — better reflects its role as a service layer wrapping go-eventkit
- **go-eventkit local replace directive** for development: `replace github.com/BRO3886/go-eventkit => ../go-eventkit`
- **Breaking `pkg/client.New()` API** — returning error is correct. The old `panic` on non-darwin was worse.
