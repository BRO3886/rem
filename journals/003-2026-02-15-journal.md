# Journal Entry 003 - 2026-02-15 - Install script, website install section, CLAUDE.md updates

## Goal

Add a curl-pipe-bash install script for `rem`, serve it from `rem.sidv.dev/install`, and update the website homepage with a tabbed install section showing all three installation methods.

## What Changed

- **`scripts/install.sh`** — New install script that:
  - Detects macOS + arch (arm64/amd64)
  - Fetches latest release tag from GitHub API
  - Downloads the correct binary from releases
  - `chmod +x` + installs to `/usr/local/bin` (with sudo if needed)
  - Cleanup via `trap` on temp dir
- **`website/static/install`** — Copy of install script served by Hugo at `rem.sidv.dev/install`
  - Usage: `curl -fsSL https://rem.sidv.dev/install | bash`
- **Homepage install section** — Replaced 2-method layout with tabbed interface:
  - **Script** tab (default, recommended) — curl one-liner
  - **Go Install** tab — `go install` with Xcode CLT note
  - **Download** tab — manual download with `chmod +x` and `mv` steps
  - CSS: segmented control style tabs matching Apple aesthetic, `fadeIn` animation on panel switch
  - JS: Tab switching with ARIA attributes
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Added "Website & Hosting" section documenting `rem.sidv.dev`, Cloudflare Pages, install script location
- **`.claude/commands/prep-for-task.md`** — Added rule to always read `CLAUDE.md` directly (not via subagent) before launching exploration agents

## Key Insights

- **Hugo `static/` dir** serves files directly at root — `website/static/install` becomes `rem.sidv.dev/install` with no redirect needed. Simpler than Cloudflare redirect rules or Workers.
- **GitHub release binaries lose execute permission** — downloaded binaries from releases don't have `+x`. The install script handles this with `chmod +x`, and the manual download tab explicitly shows the step.
- **Tabbed install UI** fits naturally into the existing design system — reuses `.install-card`, `.code-block`, `.install-label` patterns. The segmented control (`.install-tabs`) uses `var(--bg-secondary)` background with active tab getting `var(--bg-tertiary)` + subtle shadow.

## Decisions Made

- **Canonical script in `scripts/install.sh`**, copy in `website/static/install`** — two copies is a minor duplication tradeoff for having the script both in the repo root area (for GitHub browsing) and served by the site
- **Tabs over stacked cards** — three install methods stacked vertically with dividers would be too long; tabs keep it compact and let each method have its own notes/context
- **No Homebrew yet** — planned for next session; needs a tap repo and formula
